# A Simple Framework for Constrastive Learning of Visual Representation

[paper link here.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05709.pdf)

## Abstract

This paper proprosed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms `without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank.`

Especially, there are 3 points.

* composition of data argumentations plays a critical role in defining effective augmentations plays a critical role in
defining effective predictive tasks.
* Learnable non-linear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality
of the learned representations.
* Contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervising learning.
