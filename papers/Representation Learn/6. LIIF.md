# Learning Continuous Image Representation with Local Implicit Image Function

## Abstract

In this papaer, we seek to learn a continuous representation for images.

Inspired by therecent progress in 3D reconstruction with implicit neural representation, we prepose LIIF,
which takes an `image cooridnate and the 2D deep features` around the coordinate as inputs, predict the `RGB value` at a given
coordinate as an output.
