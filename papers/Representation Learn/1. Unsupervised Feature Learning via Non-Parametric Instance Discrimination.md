## Abstract

Can we learn a good feature representation that captures apparent similarity `among instances`, insted of classes,
by merely asking the `feature to be discriminative of individual instances?`

* They formulate thus intuition as a `non-parametric classification problem` at the instance-level, and use `NCE`
to tackle the computational challenges imposed by the large number of classification
* surpassess SOTA on ImageNet classificatino by a large margin.
