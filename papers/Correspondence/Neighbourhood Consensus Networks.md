## Abstract

We address the problem of finding `reliable dense correspondence` between a pair of images.
This is a challenging task due to strong appearance differences between `the corressponding scene
elements` and `ambiguities generated by repetitive patterns.`

The contributions of this work are threefold.

* We develop an `end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network architecture` that identifies sets of spatially
consistent matches by `analyzing neighbourhood consensus patterns` in the 4D space of all possible corresspondences
between a pair of images.
* We demonstrate that the model `can be trained effectively from weak supervision` in the form of mathcing and
non-matching image pairs without the need for costly manual annotation of point to point correspondences.
* We show the proposed neighbourhood consensus network `can be applied to a range of matching tasks including
both category and instance level matching.`
