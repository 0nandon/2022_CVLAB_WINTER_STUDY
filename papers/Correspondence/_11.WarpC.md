# Warp Consistency for Unsupervised Learning of Dense Correspondences

[paper link here]()

## Abstract

The key challenge in learning dense correspondences lies in the `lack of ground-truth matches` for real image pairs.

We propose WarpC, an unsupervised learning objective for dense correspondence regression.
Our objective is effective even in settings with large appearance and view-point changes.
