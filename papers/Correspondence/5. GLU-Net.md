# GLU-Net : Global-Local Universal Network for Dense Flow and Correspondences

[paper link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05524)

## Abstract

In this work, we propose a universal network architecture that is directly applicable to all
the aforementioned dense correspondence problems.

## Introduction

The general problem of estimating correspondences between pairs of images can be
divided into several different tasks.
* geometric matching
* optical flow
* semantic matching
