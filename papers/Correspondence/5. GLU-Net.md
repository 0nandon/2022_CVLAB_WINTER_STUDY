# GLU-Net : Global-Local Universal Network for Dense Flow and Correspondences

[paper link here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05524)

## Abstract

In this work, we propose a universal network architecture that is directly applicable to all
the aforementioned dense correspondence problems.

## Introduction

The general problem of estimating correspondences between pairs of images can be
divided into several different tasks.
* geometric matching
* optical flow
* semantic matching

In this work, we therefore set out to design a universal architecture that jointly addresses `all aforementioned tasks.`

One key architectural aspect shared by a variety of correspondence networks is the reliance
on correlation layers, `computing local similarities` between deep features extracted from
the two images.

There are two correlation methods below.
* `local correlations` : This is suitable for small displacements, they are unable to capture large viewpoints changes.
* `global correlations` : This is capable of handling long-range matches, but computationally unfeasible at high resolutions.
Also, they constrain the input image size to a predetermined resolution, which severely hampers accuracy for high-resolution
images.
