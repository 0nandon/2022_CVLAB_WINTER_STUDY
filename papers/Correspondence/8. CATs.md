# CATs: Cost Aggregation Transformers for Visual Correspondence

[paper link here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02520.pdf)

## Abstract

We propose a novel cost aggregation network, called Cost Aggregation Transformers(CATs), to find dense correspondences
between `semantically similar images` with additional challenges posed by large-intra class apperance and
geometric variations.

Specifically, we include a`ppearance affinity modeling` to aid the cost aggregation process in order to `disambiguate the noisy
initial correlation maps` and `propose multi-level aggregation` to efficiently capture different semantics from hierarchical feature
representations.

We then combine with swapping self-attention technique and residual connections not only to `enforce consistent matching`,
but also ease the learning process.

## Introduction

Unlike classical dense correspondence problems that consider visually similar images taken under the
geometrically constrained settings, semantic correspondence poses additional challenges from `large
intra-class appearacne` and `geometric variations` caused by the unconstrained settings of given image pair.

Recent approaches addressed this challenges by classical matching pipeline:
* feature extraction
* cost aggregation
* flow estimation

In this work, we focus on the `cost aggregation stage`, and propose a novel cost aggregation network to tackle
aforementioned issues.

* We concatenate an appearance embedding with the correlation map, which helps to disambiguate the correlation map within the Transformer.
* We use a `stack of correlation maps constructed from multi-level features`, and propose to effectively aggregate the scores
across the multi-level correlation maps.
* we consider `bidirectional` nature of correlation map, and leverage the correlation map from both directions, `obtaining
reciprocal scores` by swapping the pair of dimensions of correlation map in order to allow glpbal consensus in both perspective.
* We provide residual connections around aggregation networks in order to ease the learning process.
