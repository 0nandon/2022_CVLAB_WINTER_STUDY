# DGC-Net: Dense Geometric Correspondence Network

[paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08393.pdf)

## Abstract

In this paper, we propose a `coarse-to-fine` CNN-based framework that can leverage the advantages of
optical flow approaches and extend them to the case of large transformations providing dense and subpixel
accuate estimates.

> While optical flow methods produce very accurate results for the `small pixel transformation and limited appearance`
> variation scenarios, they hardly deal with the `strong geometric transformations` that we consider in this work.

## Introduction

The main contributions of this paper are:
* We propose an end-to-end CNN-based method, DGC-Net, to establish `dense pixel correspondences` between images with
`strong geometric transformations`.
* We demonstrate that even if DGC-Net is trained only on synthetic transformations, it can generalize well to real data.
* We apply the proposed approach to the problem of relative camera pose estimation and demonstrate that our method outperforms
strong baseline approaches by a large margin.
