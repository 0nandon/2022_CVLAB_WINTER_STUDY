## Abstract

The contributions of this work are three-fold.

* First, we propose a CNN work architecture for geometric matching. The architecture
is based on three main components that `mimic the standard steps of feature extraction, matching,
and simultaneous in-lier detection and model parameter estimation,` while being trainbale end-to-end.
* Second, network parameters can be trained from synthetically generated imagery `without the need for manual
annotation` and that our matching layer significantly increases generalization capabilities to never seen before images.
* Finally, we show that the same model can perform both instancfe-level and category-level matching giving SOTA results.

## Introduction

The traditional approach for estimating correspondences between images works well in many cases but fails
in situation that `exhibit large changes of depicted appearance` due to intra-class variation, or `large changes of
scene layout or non-rigid deformations` that require complex geometric models with many parameters.

In this work, we develop a CNN architecture that mimics the standard matching process.

First, we replce the standard local featuers with `powerful trainable CNN features`, which allows us
to handle large changes of appearance between the matched images.

Second, we develop `trainable matching and transformation estimation layers` that can cope with noisy and
incorrect matches in a robust way, mimicking the good practices in feature matching.

It can hendle `large appearance changes` and is therefore suitable for `both instance-level and category-level matching
problems.`

## Architecture for geometric matching

The architecture is designed to mimic the classical computer vision pipeline, while using `differentiable modules` so that
it is trainable end-to-end for the geometry estimation task.

There are 3 processes in this architecture.
* passing input images *I*<sub>A</sub>, *I*<sub>B</sub> through a siamese architecture consisting of CNN, thus extracting
feature maps *f*<sub>A</sub>, *f*<sub>B</sub> which are analogous to dense local descriptors.
* matching the feature maps : `global correlation`
* regresion network which directly outputs the parameters θ, of the geometric model in a robust manner.

### 3.1 Feature extraction

The first stage of the pipeline is feature extraction, for which we use a standard CNN architecture.

A CNN without fully connected layers takes an input image and produces a feature map *f* ∈ R<sup>h * w * d</sup>.

We use the VGG-16 network. As shown in Fig 2, the feature extraction network is duplicated and arranged in a siamese
configuration such that `the two input images are passed two identical networks which share parameters.`
